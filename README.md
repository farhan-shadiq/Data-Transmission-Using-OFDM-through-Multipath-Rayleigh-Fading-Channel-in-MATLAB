# Data-Transmission-Using-OFDM-through-Multipath-Rayleigh-Fading-Channel-in-MATLAB
In this project, we simulated a wireless data transmission system in MATLAB that can transmit text, audio and image data using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) through a multipath Rayleigh fading channel.
